This internship was beneficial for me in terms of the practice of software like: Revit, Autocad and Sketchup. I was also able to go on construction site of certain projects. 

I worked on the exterior and interior renovation of a listed building. Today it is a question of transforming this public space into a Buddhist center. But also to incorporate a private apartment at the bottom of the building.
This project is around the Lea Bridge area, London.

I also worked on the Sketchup modeling of a district of Colchester for a future agency project and also as well as an interior design for a private client with a research around materials.
Moreover, I worked on Revit for a housing building.
